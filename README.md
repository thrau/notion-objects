A Python library that makes it easy to work with notion databases. ðŸš§ under development!

## Usage

### Defining models

Suppose your database `tasks` has four fields, the title `Task`, a date range `Date`, and a person `Assigned to`, and a status field `Status`.
You want to transform notion database queries into records of:

```json
{"task": "my task", "date_start": "2022-01-01", "date_end": "2022-01-02", "assigned_to": "Thomas", "status": "In progress"}
```

First, declare a model that contains all the necessary transformations as descriptors:

```python
from notion_objects import *

class Task(NotionObject):
    task = TitleText("Task")
    assigned_to = Person("Assigned to")
    date_start = DateRangeStart("Date")
    date_end = DateRangeEnd("Date")
    status = Status("Status")
```

Now, when you have queried a database, you can instantiate `Task` objects with the results of the API call:

```python
response = requests.post("https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/{database_id}/query", ...)

for item in response.json()['results']:
    t = Task(item)
    print(t.task)  # access attribute values
    print(t.to_json())  # prints the record in the json format show earlier
```

### Querying Databases

notion-objects adds data-mapping around [notion-sdk-py](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py). The `Database` class
is uses a type parameter to map notion objects to the data models you defined.

Here's a code snippet showing how to iterate over all pages in a databases that were updated after 2022-10-08, using
our built-in `Page` model that holds the root page attributes.

```python
from notion_client import Client
from notion_objects import Database, Page

notion = Client(auth=os.environ['NOTION_TOKEN'])

database: Database[Page] = Database(Page, database_id="123456789abcdef1234567890abcdef1", client=notion)

result = database.query({
    "filter": {
        "timestamp": "last_edited_time",
        "last_edited_time": {
            "after": "2022-10-08"
        }
    }
})
for page in result:
    print(page.id, page.created_time, page.last_edited_time)
```

You could also use `DynamicNotionObject` if you're too lazy to create a model for your database. notion-objects will map
the data types in a best-effort way. You can also iterate directly over the database to fetch all records:

```python
from notion_objects import Database, DynamicNotionObject

database = Database(DynamicNotionObject, ...)

for record in database:
    print(record.to_json())  # will print your database record as JSON
```

**NOTE** not all types have yet been implemented. Type mapping is very rudimentary.
